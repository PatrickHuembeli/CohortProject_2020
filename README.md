## Quantum Bootcamp Cohort Project 2020

The 2020 Cohort Project is an online collaboration bringing together founders in a series of open-source challenges.
During the four-week bootcamp, founders will form teams to compete and collaborate on a set of challenges 
designed to engage science, technology, and business founders in problems related to quantum entrepreneurship.
This year's challenges will focus on Quantum Chemistry.

### Goals:  
* Technical: To calculate low-energy quantum properties of some small molecules, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of various modern approaches.
* Business: To disseminate the results of the collaboration in an open access format accessible to all quantum entrepreneurs; to identify value propositions in the various technical approaches.

### Project Legacy:
Each week your team will fork this repository to your own GitHub account to work on the challenges.  At the end of the week you will issue a pull request. CDL will choose one team's work to merge into the main upstream repository, where it will become part of the legacy of the 2020 Boot Camp.

### Weekly Challenges

* [Week 1](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2020/tree/master/Project_1_RBM_and_Tomography):  Reconstructing a quantum state from data using Machine Learning
* [Week 2](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2020/tree/master/Project_2_VQE_Molecules): Preparing an electronic structure groundstate on quantum hardware using VQE.
* [Week 3](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2020/tree/master/Project_3_Franck_Condon_Factors): Studying molecular rotational and vibronic properties.
* [Week 4](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2020/tree/master/Project_4_Ising_Annealer): Solving molecular chemistry using quantum and classical annealing.
